WELCOME TO THE GENERAL STORE! WE HAVE EVERYTHING YOU MIGHT NEED FOR YOUR JOURNEY WEST.
YOU HAVE SAVED $1200 TO SPEND FOR THE TRIP, AND YOU'VE JUST PAID $200 FOR A WAGON. YOU CAN SPEND THE REST OF YOUR MONEY ON THE FOLLOWING ITEMS:
-   OXEN - YOU CAN SPEND $100-$200 ON YOUR TEAM. IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE EXTRA YOKE
-   FOOD - YOU'LL NEED A LOT TO KEEP UP YOUR PARTY'S STRENGTH DURING THE LONG TRIP
-   AMMUNITION - $2 BUYS A BOX OF 20 BULLETS. YOU WILL NEED BULLETS FOR ATTACKS BY ANIMALS AND BANDITS, AND FOR HUNTING FOOD
-   WAGON WHEELS - SPARE PARTS TO HELP GET YOU BACK ON THE TRAIL WHEN YOUR WAGON BREAKS DOWN
-   MEDICAL KITS - THESE WILL HELP YOU AND YOUR PARTY MEMBERS IF THEY GET SICK OR INJURED
YOU CAN SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY BEFORE YOU START YOUR TRIP, OR YOU CAN SAVE SOME OF YOUR CASH TO SPEND AT FORTS ALONG THE WAY WHEN YOU RUN LOW. 
HOWEVER, ITEMS COST MORE AT THE FORTS. YOU CAN ALSO GO HUNTING ALONG THE WAY TO GET MORE FOOD.
